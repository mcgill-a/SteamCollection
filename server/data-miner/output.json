Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. <br><br>The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?<br><br>Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.<br></li><li>CRIMENET \u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;, and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.<br></li><li>PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.<br></li><li>Dynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.<br></li><li>Choose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.<br></li><li>More Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations.  <br></li><li>Weapons and Modifications \u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?<br></li><li>Play It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.<br></li><li>New Game Content All the Time \u2013 More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017.</li></ul>", "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail":

available!</strong><br>To activate VR mode please download this free DLC: <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/826090/PAYDAY_2_VR/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PAYDAY 2: VR</a><br><br>PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. <br><br>The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?<br><br>Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.<br></li><li>CRIMENET \u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;, and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.<br></li><li>PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.<br></li><li>Dynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.<br></li><li>Choose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.<br></li><li>More Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations.  <br></li><li>Weapons and Modifications \u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?<br></li><li>Play It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.<br></li><li>New Game Content All the Time \u2013 More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017.</li></ul>", "short_description": "PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.", "developers": ["OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio."], "type": "game", "supported_languages": "English<strong>*</strong>, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Russian<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support", "website": "http://www.overkillsoftware.com/", "publishers": ["Starbreeze Publishing AB"], "pc_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows 10<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2.3 GHz Intel Quad Core Processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>8 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Nvidia &amp; AMD (1GB VRAM)<br>\t</li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:</strong>9.0c<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>45 GB HD space<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>DirectX 9.0c compatible</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows 7<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>2 GHz Intel Dual Core Processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>4 GB RAM<br>\t</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>Nvidia &amp; AMD (512MB VRAM)<br>\t</li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:</strong>9.0c<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>31 GB HD space <br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>DirectX 9.0c compatible</li></ul>"}, "recommendations": {"total": 204571}, "is_free": false, "legal_notice": "PAYDAY 2 is a trademark of Starbreeze AB.

award-winning formula of innovative gameplay, story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry accolades and created a cult following.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe game\u2019s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br><br>\r\n\t\tNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology.

"<strong>Partner with legendary impresario Tony Prince to open and operate a top shelf Nightclub featuring world-class DJ acts Solomun, Tale Of Us, Dixon and The Black Madonna, and use it as a front for the most concentrated network of criminal enterprise ever to hit San Andreas. </strong><br><br>When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other.<br> <br>Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames per second. <br> <br>The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support.  <br> <br>Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators. Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes.<br> <br>The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way.<br> <br>Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor\u2019s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game\u2019s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing.  <br> <br>Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.<br><br>Special access content requires Rockstar Games Social Club account.

In this one we're making a number of big changes and it's time for another make-over for Proxy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FRAGMENT CASE UPDATE</h2><br>Long story short, Fragment Cases will no longer drop after you complete matches.<br><br>Short story long, we know that many of you find the Fragment cases a little underwhelming when you earn them and they're added to your inventory, so we thought of a better way for you to earn Fragments in a bit of a more interesting way (Read the next section to find out what)<br><br>Psst. If you have any Fragment Cases in your inventory, don't worry! Those won't be going anywhere, so you can save them for the memories or open them at your leisure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INCREASED LOADOUT CASE DROP RATES</h2><br>Enter the replacement for Fragment Cases! We've more than DOUBLED the drop rate of Loadout Cases at the end of matches so your Loadout Card earn rate will increase significantly. But how does this give you more Fragments? Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average over time than you were before.<br><br>With this update we've also added your Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have. This should also help new and existing players get to know the Crafting system a bit more, making it easier to interact with and giving it more visibility.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OBSIDIAN OPERATIVE PROXY</h2><br>Skydaddy brought home the bacon in the last update with his epic Obsidian overhaul, but now it's Proxy's turn to bring home a bigger piece of bacon (and hopefully a better metaphor).<br><br>When trying to describe this Obsidian it's difficult to not use words like &quot;f*****g awesome&quot;, &quot;holy s**t&quot; and &quot;very nice&quot;. But don't take it from me, check it out in game!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/333930/extras/Proxy-OBOPs-Social_800x450.jpg?t=1535445339\" ><br><br>*drops mic*<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUG FIXES</h2><br><strong>General</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fixed issue where the individual Merc drop-down filter did not show any Merc Decks<br></li><li>Improved attacking hitbox of the Ulu<br></li><li>Fixed issue where the Founder's Fragger model would incorrectly load at a certain distance</li></ul><br>Want to chat about it some more?

With no controller support or aim assist, all that lies between you and certain death is player skill and reaction. Work together or die alone in the most challenging team-based FPS. <br><br>A string of 'dirty bomb' attacks cripple London, leaving the Central Disaster Authority to restore it. When criminal syndicate Jackal begin disrupting and stealing their technology, the capital is thrown into chaos as mercenaries from across the globe are hired by both sides.<br><br>That's where you come in.

Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack.  Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>All-New Characters and All-New Classes:</strong> Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from!<br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN:</strong> Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other!<br><br></li><li><strong>World Connected Story:</strong>  Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)<br><br></li><li><strong>87 Bazillion...Everything:</strong> In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new environments on Pandora:</strong> Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new enemies:</strong>  A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.</li></ul>Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only.", "short_description": "The Ultimate Vault Hunter\u2019s Upgrade lets you get the most out of the Borderlands 2 experience.", "developers": ["Gearbox Software", "Aspyr (Mac)", "Aspyr (Linux)"], "type": "game", "supported_languages": "English<strong>*</strong>, French<strong>*</strong>, German<strong>*</strong>, Italian<strong>*</strong>, Japanese<strong>*</strong>, Spanish<strong>*</strong>, Korean, Traditional Chinese<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support", "website": "http://www.borderlands2.com/", "publishers": ["2K", "Aspyr (Mac)", "Aspyr (Linux)"], "pc_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP3/Vista/Win 7<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.3 GHz Quad Core processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 20 GB free<br>\t</li><li><strong>Video Memory:</strong> 512MB<br>\t</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 / ATI Radeon HD 5850<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c Compatible<br>\t</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong>Initial installation requires one-time internet connection for Steam authentication; software installations required (included with the game) include Steam Client, DirectX 9, Microsoft .NET 4 Framework, Visual C++ Redistributable 2005, Visual C++ Redistributable 2008, Visual C++ Redistributable 2010, and AMD CPU Drivers (XP Only/AMD Only)</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP3<br>\t</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4 GHz Dual Core Processor<br>\t</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB(XP)/ 2 GB(Vista)<br>\t</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 13 GB free<br>\t</li><li><strong>Video Memory:</strong> 256 MB<br>\t</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 8500 /ATI Radeon HD 2600<br>\t</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c Compatible<br>\t</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong>Initial installation requires one-time internet connection for Steam authentication; software installations required (included with the game) include Steam Client, DirectX 9, Microsoft .NET 4 Framework, Visual C++ Redistributable 2005, Visual C++ Redistributable 2008, Visual C++ Redistributable 2010, and AMD CPU Drivers (XP Only/AMD Only)</li></ul>"}, "recommendations": {"total": 84858}, "is_free": false, "legal_notice": "\u00a9 2009 - 2017 Gearbox Software, LLC.

Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle.

More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/RPG.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HighEndNextGenVisuals.png?t=1529427276\" ><br><br>The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Right at the outset, five huntable species (Whitetail Deer, European Rabbit and Pheasant, plus two more animals rotating weekly), two weapons (.243 Bolt-Action Rifle &amp; 12 GA Single Shot shotgun) and a great equipment loadout is available at no cost. Additional items such as weapons, species, licenses and ammunition can be acquired with gm$, in-game currency that can be earned through playing the game, or em$, in-game currency that can be purchased for real-life money or earned through winning in-game competitions.<br><br>By hunting certain species and using certain items in the game, you are able to hone your skills and improve as a hunter.

With time and practice, you will be able to tell weight and gender from a simple animal track, and develop steadier aim for a range of weapons.<br><br>Achievements can be earned through diverse in-game activities. Each achievement adds to your HunterScore, which can be used to track and compare your progress with other hunters. Increasing your HunterScore also unlocks upgrade items such as pouches and holsters for your rifles.", "short_description": "The most realistic hunting experience awaits.

Slip the surly bonds of earth and take to the skies as a bold Captain, fearless Gunner, or cunning Engineer. Raising the stakes on team-based PvP combat with an emphasis on strategic competition and team play, Guns of Icarus Online is all about teamwork, tactics, and fast-paced action. With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A vivid steampunk world </strong> </h2>Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build your own airship </strong> </h2>Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Your ship is your life </strong> </h2>Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - \u201clife\u201d - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The ultimate multiplayer team experience </strong> </h2>You won\u2019t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together. It\u2019s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Goggles, gears, and glory </strong> </h2>A wide range of costumes and cosmetic options to show off your style are available in the in-game store. These items are cosmetic only - there is no pay-to-win in Guns of Icarus Online.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Pit crew against crew </strong></h2>Form a party with up to 4 friends and crew a ship together to battle against other teams in massive airship battles with up to 32 players in a match with multiple game modes including Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Crazy King, Skyball, and VIP.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rise in the ranks </strong> </h2>Earn titles and cosmetic upgrades through your achievements. Balanced, competitive matches reward strategic, skillful play, not level grinding.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/GOIA_Steam_Header_2.png?t=1536787177\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/pr_wide_angle.jpg?t=1536787177\" ><br><br>The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback.<br>Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/GOIA_Steam_Header_5.png?t=1536787177\" ><br><br>We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, <i>Flight of the Icarus</i>, was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game <i>CreaVures</i> in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game.<br><br>We released <i>Guns of Icarus Online</i> in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the <i>Guns of Icarus</i> experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - <i>Guns of Icarus Alliance</i>, the ultimate and definitive <i>Guns of Icarus experience</i> - which released in March 2017.</li></ul>", "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail":

laid the groundwork for the expanded <i>Guns of Icarus</i> experience, <i>Guns of Icarus Alliance</i>. Slip the surly bonds of earth and take to the skies as a bold Captain, fearless Gunner, or cunning Engineer. Raising the stakes on team-based PvP combat with an emphasis on strategic competition and team play, Guns of Icarus Online is all about teamwork, tactics, and fast-paced action. With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A vivid steampunk world </strong> </h2>Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build your own airship </strong> </h2>Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Your ship is your life </strong> </h2>Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - \u201clife\u201d - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The ultimate multiplayer team experience </strong> </h2>You won\u2019t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together. It\u2019s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Goggles, gears, and glory </strong> </h2>A wide range of costumes and cosmetic options to show off your style are available in the in-game store. These items are cosmetic only - there is no pay-to-win in Guns of Icarus Online.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Pit crew against crew </strong></h2>Form a party with up to 4 friends and crew a ship together to battle against other teams in massive airship battles with up to 32 players in a match with multiple game modes including Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Crazy King, Skyball, and VIP.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rise in the ranks </strong> </h2>Earn titles and cosmetic upgrades through your achievements. Balanced, competitive matches reward strategic, skillful play, not level grinding.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/GOIA_Steam_Header_2.png?t=1536787177\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/pr_wide_angle.jpg?t=1536787177\" ><br><br>The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback.<br>Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/209080/extras/GOIA_Steam_Header_5.png?t=1536787177\" ><br><br>We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, <i>Flight of the Icarus</i>, was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game <i>CreaVures</i> in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game.<br><br>We released <i>Guns of Icarus Online</i> in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the <i>Guns of Icarus</i> experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - <i>Guns of Icarus Alliance</i>, the ultimate and definitive <i>Guns of Icarus experience</i> - which released in March 2017.</li></ul>", "short_description": "Assemble your crew, take to the skies in the premier PvP airship combat game.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed.
